lets do the setup in a way that we will have a good work after all

now i want you to call this nextjs project we are about to create EKD Digital Resource Hub

i created this folder so that we can write the project in it

web/andgroupco/rhub

note that it won't only be the conversion project. but we will have multiple resources from EKD Digital that people can use easilly on it. can we do that. 

we want to work in a scalable form, a modular approach and strictly follow the dry principle. we will use mysql and prisma. can we do the work. lets make sure to use route group acordingly so that we group certain content for easy organization. can we do it.
