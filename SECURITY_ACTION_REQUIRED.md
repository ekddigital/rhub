# 🚨 Security Audit Summary - Action Required

**Audit Date:** February 21, 2026  
**Status:** ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

---

## Critical Finding

### Bank Information PDF is Publicly Exposed

📁 **File:** `public/secrets/Bank_Info.pdf`  
🔓 **Access:** Publicly accessible at `https://rhub.ekddigital.com/secrets/Bank_Info.pdf`  
📊 **Location:** Committed to git repository  
⚡ **Risk:** CRITICAL

---

## What This Means

✅ Your bank information document is accessible to anyone on the internet.  
✅ The file has been tracked in git history (not just current state).  
✅ Removing it from your file system is NOT ENOUGH—must remove from git history.

---

## Immediate Actions (Today)

### Action 1: Remove Bank_Info.pdf from Git (15 mins)

```bash
cd /Volumes/1tb_ssd/EKD_Space/Documents/coding_env/web/andgroupco/rhub

# Option A: Use BFG (faster, recommended)
bfg --delete-files Bank_Info.pdf
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now
git push origin --force-with-lease

# Option B: Use git filter-branch (slower but official)
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f public/secrets/Bank_Info.pdf' HEAD
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now
git push origin --force-with-lease
```

**📖 Full guide:** See `REMOVE_SECRETS_GUIDE.md`

### Action 2: Rotate All Credentials (30 mins)

The following secrets are exposed in `.env` (local file, not in git):

```
❌ TO ROTATE:
- Database Password: [REDACTED]...
- TTYD API Key: [REDACTED]...
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET: [REDACTED]...
- Google OAuth Secret: [REDACTED]...
- EKDSend API Key: [REDACTED]...
```

**Steps:**

1. [ ] Change MySQL database password
2. [ ] Regenerate TTYD_KEY in ttyd.ekddigital.com
3. [ ] Generate new `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: `openssl rand -base64 32`
4. [ ] Rotate Google OAuth in Google Cloud Console
5. [ ] Regenerate EKDSend API key
6. [ ] Update `.env` with all new values
7. [ ] Deploy updated server with new credentials

### Action 3: Protect Against Future Incidents (10 mins)

```bash
# Update .gitignore (ALREADY DONE ✅)
cat .gitignore | grep "public/secrets"
# Should show: public/secrets/

# Commit the gitignore change
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: protect sensitive directories"
git push origin main
```

## Medium-Term Actions (Next 24 Hours)

### Set Up Secret Scanning

```bash
# Install pre-commit secret scanning
npm install --save-dev git-secrets
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "git-secrets --scan"

# Add to package.json
npm set scripts.secrets:check "git-secrets --scan"
```

**📖 Full guide:** See `SECRET_SCANNING_SETUP.md`

## Long-Term Improvements (This Week)

1. **Use a Secrets Manager**
   - 1Password
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - Doppler.com

2. **Enable CI/CD Scanning**
   - GitHub Secret Scanning
   - GitGuardian
   - TruffleHog in GitHub Actions

3. **Team Training**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use `FILENAME.example` for templates
   - Review all commits for sensitive data

4. **Regular Audits**
   - Weekly: `npm run secrets:check:all`
   - Monthly: Code review for best practices
   - Quarterly: Full security audit

## What Was Checked ✅

| Category       | Status       | Details                                           |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Source Code    | ✅ CLEAN     | No hardcoded secrets in `/src`                    |
| Config Files   | ✅ CLEAN     | No credentials in `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` |
| Comments       | ✅ CLEAN     | No password hints in code comments                |
| Build Output   | ✅ CLEAN     | No secrets in `.next/static` or builds            |
| External Files | ⚠️ CRITICAL  | `public/secrets/Bank_Info.pdf` is PUBLIC          |
| .env File      | ✅ PROTECTED | Properly gitignored but contains live secrets     |

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Force Push Impact:**
When you remove the file from git history, you'll need to force push.  
All team members must then:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main  # NOT git merge!
```

🔑 **Credential Rotation:**
These are PRODUCTION credentials. Any delay in rotation means the exposed keys remain valid.

📊 **Bank Info Risk Level:**

- **Confidentiality:** CRITICAL (financial information exposed)
- **Integrity:** HIGH (could be modified)
- **Availability:** MEDIUM (resource at risk)

## Verification Checklist

After completing all actions:

```bash
# 1. Verify file is removed from history
git log --all --full-history -- "**Bank_Info.pdf" | wc -l
# Should output: 0

# 2. Verify .gitignore protects future files
echo "test" > public/secrets/test.txt
git status | grep test.txt
# Should show: nothing to commit (file ignored)

# 3. Test secret scanning
echo "api_test123456" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test"
# Should FAIL if setup correctly

# 4. Verify git history is clean
npm run secrets:check:all
# Should output: No secrets found
```

## Need Help?

### If git filter-branch fails:

1. Create a fresh clone: `git clone [url] rhub-clean`
2. Run commands in the fresh clone
3. Compare results carefully before pushing

### If credentials are still exposed:

1. Force push: `git push --force-with-lease`
2. Rotate ALL credentials immediately
3. Review server logs for unauthorized access

### For team coordination:

1. Announce cleanup via Slack/email BEFORE force push
2. Have everyone stop work for 10 minutes
3. Force push, then have all team members `git rebase origin/main`
4. Verify everyone has clean repos with `git status`
